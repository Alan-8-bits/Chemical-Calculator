# Chemical-Calculator
A single static page to make responsive chemical calculations. All libraries and styles are in this single file so just download it and enjoy!.
It was made this way to use the power of the (html,css) interfaces, avoid creating a whole executable program, and get rid of installation processes.

A student of chemistry came to me to develop this calculator because he cant find a free and easy-to-use option.
